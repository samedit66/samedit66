## Who am I?

Still trying to know that myself - but in the meantime I make small, useful things and experiment with language ideas. Currently becoming a functional-programming adept.

---

## What I do

I build small, well-crafted things - compilers that whisper, bots that behave, and tools that get the job done with as little fuss as possible.

---

## What I use

- Elixir
- Gleam
- Python
